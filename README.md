-   ### Design

    -   #### Structure
    
        -   The stucture of the website was purposely designed to maintain a fluid, consistent display throughout as to not look cluttered, easy to navigate and easy to find                 what you are looking for.
        
    -   #### Pages: All pages contained the following elements.
        -   Header/Footer: Defining clean and simple navigation to what the user is looking for.
        -   Website Brand Logo: On all pages the Brand logo sits on the Navbar and is a clickable link to redirect to the homepage.
        -   Website Colors and Font: Website colors and font remain consistent throughout.
    
    -   #### Colour Scheme
    
        -   The color scheme on my website was basded off of the business card from Brunas private practice where I wanted to keep it consistent throughout and where it was                 clean and simple and appealing to look at. I used a "mint green" trim color with a dark blue background across all pages for consistency. The members page was                   colored in gold representing the status of members, VIP etc.
        
        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/bruna_fernandes_phsiotherapy_m2/blob/master/assets/colors/palette_colors.png?raw=true"></h2>
            
    -   #### Typography
    
        -   [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree) is the main font used throughout the whole website with San-serif as the fallback font in                   case for any reason the font isn't being recognized on different operating systems. Bree Serif is a professional looking font, it has characteristics that speak                 "professional", I like the shape and the style of the font and I feel it represents the professionalism I am looking to create.
        
    -   #### Imagery
   
        -   Imagery in this website is clear and intuitive for learning purposes
